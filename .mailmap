# This file maps old author names/emails to anonymized versions
# Format: Proper Name <proper@email.xx> <commit@email.xx>
# Note: The old email must be present in this file for Git to perform the mapping.
# This is the standard Git mechanism for anonymizing commit history without rewriting history.
